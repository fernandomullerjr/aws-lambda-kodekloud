# AWS Lambda Functions

Lambda contains a Function that executes the programming code in one of the supported programming languages.

The user can bring the code without changing its bulk, but a function handler must be included.

The function handler has two objects: the event object and the context object.

Event Object: Allows the event source to pass information
to the Lambda function.

Context Object: Contains information specific to the
runtime environment of the programming language used
and allows communication within the function.

The configuration of the code specifics depends on the
programming language used.
